                <h3>What's risograph?</h3>
                <p>In short, it's digital screen printing! The risograph printer looks like a photocopier but works like a screenprinter. Using spot colors and stencils, it creates unique printing results.</p>

                    <p>"The process is perfect for graphic art (vector based work) typography, and illustration, but also works wonders across painting and photography using variations of CMYK."</p>

                <h3>How does Riso Work?</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The machine uses your uploaded or scanned image to make paper stencil. This stencil wraps around the ink drum. This process is calling making <strong>masters</strong></li>
                    <li>Paper is placed on the feeder and passed through one or two of the ink drums</li>
                    <li>The machine creates a digital stamp of the individual colors and together they create a colorful, vibrant image.</li>
                </ol>
